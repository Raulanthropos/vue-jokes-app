## Notes

- All joke data is fetched from [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/).
- This project is built using the Composition API.
- localStorage is used to persist your favorites even after a refresh or revisit.
- Although I’m familiar with TypeScript, I chose not to use it in this project as I haven’t worked with it recently.
